                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p><span>Here at Auntie Em's Inc,</span> we do more than just house or pet sitting since 2009.
                    We  take care of the things most important to you when you are away. We keep
                    your home safe and looking lived in while also taking care of your pets. We
                    keep them happy and healthy while you are away so you can spend your time
                    worry-free. We promise to love your pets as much as you do and treat them as
                    our own. We believe that you and your pets will be happier with a live-in
                    sitter rather than being lonely and stressed out in a pet-boarding facility.
                    We are certified by both the National Association of Professional Pet sitters
                    and Pet Sitters International. We are bonded and insured through Pet Sitters
                    Associates.</p>
